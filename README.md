* Meant to be an alternative to soundcloud

## Soundcloud shortcomings
1. Soundcloud adds copyright strikes when someone tries to upload a remix of a licensed track
	- We will use machine learning n shit to detect when a track is being illegally uploaded.
	- Rather than giving copyright strikes, we'll let them know the track is licensed before they uplaod.
	- We can detect by track title, and by analyzing the track itself.

2. Laws involving remixes on copyrighted tracks are difficult to understand.
	- Use all our business major friends to find loopholes in licensing.
	- End goal: you can upload remixes of any track at all, you just can't monetize copyrighted ones.

3. Soundcloud doesn't offer any aid to marketing your track after you upload.
	- We'll incorperate a pandora-style streaming service.
	- Likes/dislikes here reset daily.
	- More likes = higher probability to be played.
	- More dislikes = less probability to be played = possibility of being removed for the day.
	- The dislike feature filters out obvious troll songs and provide instant feedback to the artist.
	- Listeners now have the ability to hear fresh underground artists that they wouldn't be able to hear otherwise.


## Why contribute?
1. Learn good team project schools, as well as version control.
	- Two huge plusses in the eyes of a hiring team.

2. Possibly help underground artists.
	- The streaming service could eliminate the need for an artist to have to market.
		- Marketing is over half of the battle to becoming a popular artist.
		- Marketing is impossible/extremely difficult if you aren't popular/wealthy to begin with.
		- Getting instant feedback is difficult if no one listens to your song.
	- By taking care of marketing, artists focus more on making better music.

## How can we make this happen?
1. Have UI/Frontend devs that create the best user experience possible.
2. Have a team with great communication..
3. Backend devs focus on a great backend system.
